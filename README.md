# Argos plugin for web site service discovery

A plugin for [Argos](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos).

It creates a drop-down menu listing the websites being published using
service discovery (`_https._tcp` and `_http._tcp`).

## Troubleshooting

Not related to this plugin, but Argos itself.

I had to install a fork of Argos because of
[p-e-w/argos#120: Argos menus won't open on Ubuntu 20.04](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos/issues/120)
